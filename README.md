The percent_bar class allows to print out progress in percent and timing estimations of a process.
Optionally, information on the self time of the percent_bar class can be printed.

Default is to use MATLAB 'waitbar'. Specifying 'CMDLINE' as true in varargin prints progress in commandline, which may be faster improving self time.
